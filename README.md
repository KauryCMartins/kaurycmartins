# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, I'm Kaury and I have a passion for both numbers and codes. I'm studying Economics, which is a fascinating field that explores how people make choices and interact in the world. But I also enjoy programming, which is a creative and rewarding skill that allows me to build amazing things with logic and algorithms. I love learning new languages, both human and computer ones, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

**About me**
  
- ðŸ“Œ I am a data analyst who loves to explore, organize and visualize data.
- ðŸ“š I'm currently improving my skills in Python, SQL, MongoDB and R.
- ðŸ“Ž   Besides that, I like watching anime and play video games in my spare time.

*NOTE: Top languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, it's a github metric of which languages i have the most code on github, it's a new feature of [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)*
